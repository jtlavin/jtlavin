### Hi there, I'm Jose 👋

I'm a Data Scientist/Data Engineer with a background in economics. I mainly write code with Python, SQL and I'm currently learning C++.

Here is some of the stuff I enjoy doing:
* Coding things that are useful to others
* Understand the fundamentals on different fields
* Designing machine learning systems

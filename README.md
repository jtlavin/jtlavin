### Hi there, I'm Jose ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data engineer with a background in economics. I mainly write code with Python, SQL and currently I am learning JavaScript.

Here is some of the stuff I enjoy doing:
* Designing machine learning systems
* Put stuff in production
* Coding things that are useful to others
* Understand the fundamentals on different fields
* Work with data and APIs
